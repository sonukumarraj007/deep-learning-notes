\chapter{Fully Connected Layer}
FC layers, also called affine layers, produce the high-level reasoning in the DNN. Neurons in a fully connected layer have full connections to all activations in the previous layer, as in regular Neural Networks. Their activations can hence be computed with a matrix multiplication followed by a bias offset.
